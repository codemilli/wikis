# What People Say About Guard

Here's how Guard has helped others:

> *"For dev and devops, I use Vim, TMux and Guard. Productivity is through the roof - no more "typing in" commands. I just open a file, edit and hit save - Guard does everything else (building, testing, deploying, etc.)."*

(feel free to add a snippet about your own experiences with Guard)

> *"I've been a user of Guard from the moment I discovered it, it really improved the ease with which I could test. Guard's tests are also a boon to developers who want to see a good canonical example of testing. I often just browse the files to learn something new. Also the Guard maintainers are awesome, and will answer questions from new users."*

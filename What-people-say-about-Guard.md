# What People Say About Guard

Here's how Guard has helped others:

---
> *"For dev and devops, I use Vim, TMux and Guard. Productivity is through the roof - no more "typing in" commands. I just open a file, edit and hit save - Guard does everything else (building, testing, deploying, etc.)."*

> Cezary Baginski <cezary@chronomantic.net>

> *"I've been a user of Guard from the moment I discovered it, it really improved the ease with which I could test. Guard's tests are also a boon to developers who want to see a good canonical example of testing. I often just browse the files to learn something new. Also the Guard maintainers are awesome, and will answer questions from new users."*

> *"Like the previous testimonial from Daniël, I've been using Guard for testing from the moment I discovered it. I use it with Minitest for doing Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Guard running the associated test file automatically upon saving. It's just a great workflow. A heartfelt 'thank you!' to the Guard creators and maintainers."*

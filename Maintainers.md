# Info for new Guard maintainers

Thanks for being interested in maintaining Guard!

First, both Guard and Listen are sometimes at bit complex at places - and both are used by many users, so I'd suggest finding a way of helping you enjoy.

You can also decide how involved you want to be - from just helping users with casual problems, to development towards Guard 3.x

# Status

Both Guard and Listen are very stable and quite robust right now - issues are rarely reported, so it's a good time for development.

# Ideas to you can start with:

1. Every now and then, check the Guard Google Group and StackOverflow #Guard tag for reported problems and create issues for them in GitHub here (I track only GitHub issues, so if people have problems in the group, I probably won't know because I rarely check).
2. Mention me (@e2) in GitHub whenever there's a tough problem related to Guard or Listen (I track most Guard plugins, so I usually get messages)
3. Watch the projects Guard, Listen and any other Guard plugins you use frequently (I have access to many, so I can often quickly release a fixed version)
4. Skim through the Wiki sections in Guard and Listen - most problems users have are either know or have workarounds.
5. Simplify and improve documentation wherever you can (the less, the simpler, the better)
6. Go through open issues (in Guard, Listen or any plugins you're interested in) and see if there's anything you'd like to work on (I'm not actively working on any, so they are all up for grabs)
7. You can go through the code and TODOs to refactor/improve
8. If you want to actively develop anything towards Guard 3x or if you have ideas - just open an issue and I'll help as much as I can.  So check if there's something you'd like doing, create some pull requests, I'll help you get them merged and then you can decide if you liked the experience.

If your contributions show you know your way around (just enough to avoid breaking things for user) I'd be happy to give you maintainer/owner access.
